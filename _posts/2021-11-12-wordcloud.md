Word Cloud is a data visualization technique that could be used to present text data. The size of the word could indicate the frequency or the importance of the words. Combined with TF-IDF, it could better illustrate the important issues in the text. Such application could be very useful in reports and presentations.

TF-IDF refers a statistical measure that evaluates how relevant a word is to a document in a collection of documents. TF refers to term frequency and IDF is the inverse document frequency.
